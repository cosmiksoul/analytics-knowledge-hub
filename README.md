# Data Analytics Technical Toolbox & Reference Standards

This repository is a curated collection of **technical cheat sheets, reference frameworks, and optimization guides**. 

In my experience leading analytics teams, I’ve found that high-velocity delivery depends on standardized execution. This "Toolbox" serves as a foundational resource to ensure every analyst—from junior to senior—has instant access to industry-best practices and technical benchmarks.

## The Purpose
* **Standardization:** Ensuring consistent SQL patterns, Python logic, and statistical rigor across the department.
* **Efficiency:** Reducing "syntax research" time so the team can focus on strategic insights rather than documentation lookups.
* **Quality Assurance:** Providing a baseline for peer reviews and technical audits.

## What’s Inside

### SQL & Data Engineering
* **Optimization:** Query performance patterns for **BigQuery** and Snowflake.
* **Window Functions:** Reference guides for complex time-series and cohort calculations.
* **Modeling:** dbt patterns and data warehousing architecture basics.

### Python for Data Science
* **Manipulation:** Advanced Pandas & NumPy snippets for data cleaning and ETL.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib/Seaborn standards for executive-level charting.
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn cheat sheets for predictive LTV and churn modeling.

### Statistics & Experimentation
* **A/B Testing:** Statistical power, significance levels, and sample size calculation formulas.
* **Distributions:** Decision trees for choosing the right statistical tests (t-test, chi-square, etc.).
* **Metrics:** Deep dives into Unit Economics (LTV/CAC) and Attribution modeling.

### Mobile & Growth
* **Attribution:** Logic maps for Adjust, AppsFlyer, and SKAdNetwork.
* **Event Tracking:** Standardized naming conventions and taxonomy templates.

## Impact on Team Velocity
By utilizing these reference materials, my teams have historically:
1. **Reduced onboarding time** by providing an immediate technical "north star."
2. **Improved code maintainability** through shared technical standards.
3. **Minimized errors** in statistical reporting and financial modeling.
