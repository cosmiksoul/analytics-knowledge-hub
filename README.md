# The Analytics Playbook: Scaling Teams & Technical Excellence

**A strategic framework for standardizing data operations, accelerating team upskilling, and ensuring technical rigor.**

This repository is a curated collection of **technical blueprints, optimization patterns, and reference guides**. In my experience leading analytics divisions (SoftSwiss, Parimatch, Admixer), I’ve found that high-velocity delivery depends on standardized execution and a unified technical "North Star."

## The Purpose

* **Standardization:** Ensuring consistent SQL patterns, Python logic, and statistical rigor across the entire department.
* **Upskilling & Onboarding:** Acting as a core training framework for transitioning web analysts into full-stack data analytics roles.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Reducing "syntax research" time, allowing the team to focus on strategic insights rather than documentation lookups.
* **Quality Assurance:** Providing a baseline for peer reviews and end-to-end technical audits.

## What’s Inside

### SQL & Data Engineering
* **Optimization:** Query performance patterns for **BigQuery** and **ClickHouse**.
* **Window Functions:** Reference guides for complex time-series and cohort calculations.
* **Data Modeling:** dbt patterns and scalable data warehousing architecture basics.

### Python for Data Science
* **Manipulation:** Advanced Pandas & NumPy snippets for data cleaning and ETL automation.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn standards for executive-level storytelling and charting.
* **Machine Learning:** Reference materials for **Predictive LTV** and churn modeling using Scikit-learn.

### Statistics & Experimentation
* **A/B Testing:** Statistical power, significance levels, and sample size calculation frameworks.
* **Statistical Tests:** Decision trees for selecting the right methodology (t-test, chi-square, etc.).
* **Metrics:** Deep dives into **Unit Economics (LTV/CAC)** and multi-touch attribution modeling.

### Mobile & Growth
* **Attribution:** Logic maps for **Adjust, AppsFlyer**, and **SKAdNetwork**.
* **Event Tracking:** Standardized naming conventions and taxonomy templates for high-load systems.
